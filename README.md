UISimpleKit
===========

Set of Obj-C categories to simplify work with UIKit for lazy people like me.

### UIView+SimplePosition
Faster positioning with exposing the frame's x, y, width and height properties on the UIView, so they can be read and set like in JavaScript.

### UIColor+SimpleColor
Ability to define color from a hex value (works with and without "#"), as well as 8-bit (0-255) RGB value. Both have functions with alpha as well.
